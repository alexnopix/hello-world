# hello-world
New to GitHub. Following the Hello-World tutorial project.
Now making a commit as part of the tutorial and adding a bit of information about why I'm interested in GitHub.

I decided to investigate GitHub as I intend to use some open source projects to learn more about how software is built with a view to starting a career in Software. The next steps will be, to download and learn to use GIT, and to find a simple Java project to work on.

N.B. I note that I have changed the capitllisation of of the word 'Tutorial' to lowercase above. This does not seem to be reflected in the preview changes so I will be interested to see what happens after the commit. *Update: As expected the changes to case were updated. Also found that enclosing in asterix creates these blue comments!*
